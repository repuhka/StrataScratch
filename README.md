# StrataScratch

[StrataScratch](https://www.stratascratch.com) is a platform that provides the building blocks for a successful career in data science. In my own words, a vast amount of interview questions/projects (both coding and no-coding) for a data professional to imrpove their skills. The purpose of this repository is to publish my answers to the coding challenges from their free plan.
